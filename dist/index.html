          <h2>Coding Journey</h2>
          <p>
            Born out of an unhealthy obsession to fixate on small problems, my
            coding journey started in early 2020. At the time, I worked in sales
            and operations for a small business in the home improvement
            industry. I became frustrated with the lack of a ``ctrl + a`` /
            "select all" shortcut in our POS system that was nearly ubiquitous
            in other software. Searching online, I was pleasantly surprised with
            the number of people who were bothered by relatively minor things
            like keyboard shortcuts, and how that community made the solution
            simple and accessible. This was in direct contrast to the
            watered-down support of professional software tools I was using on a
            daily basis. Empowered by my findings, I immediately began
            copy-pasting code from Stack Overflow and breaking things. Although
            ignorance proved no obstacle for me, I eventually employed
            successful solutions to a number of problems.
          </p>
          <h3>Early Solutions</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Sheets to Calendar</strong>: Navigating / transferring
              data between QuickBooks desktop and the Google ecosystem via the
              UI is slow and mistake-prone. I created an AHK (AutoHotkey) script
              to pull CSV reports from QuickBooks to Sheets for manual
              manipulation. Purchase orders could then be added in groups or by
              line item to Google Calendar. This solution eliminated simple
              human error when manually transferring dates and SKUs repeatedly.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Margin Calculator</strong>: Determining a final price/sqft
              for a product can be tricky, especially while negotiating with a
              customer. Vendor-specific surcharges, shipping, material type, and
              customer “tier” are essential to factor into the final price when
              selling in a competitive market. I created a calculator using AHK
              that allows the user to input the variables above and see a table
              of prices aligned with tiered margins. The program was designed to
              sit on top of any price books referenced in the browser, making it
              simple for salespeople to determine a fair, but profitable price
              quickly.

              A static webpage advertising local, solo guitar performance. The
              media the client provided was hosted on Facebook and the client's
              profile was not relevant to his business. I migrated them off
              Facebook and hosted them in an Amazon S3 bucket.
