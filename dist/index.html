              My coding journey began in 2020 when I created an Autohotkey
              script that added the control + a / select all shortcut to
              Quickbooks Desktop. From there, I began utilizing Javascript in
              the Google Workspace ecosystem to extend Sheets. At the time, I
              worked for a small business in the home impovment industry as an
              operations manager. These early projects enabled me to catch user
              error and disseminate relevant information to accounting, the
              designer, and the customer effectively.

                <strong>Sheets to Calendar</strong>: Navigating and transferring
                data between the QB, Calendar, and Sheets UI is slow and
                mistake-prone. I created an AHK script to pull CSV reports from
                QB for manual manipulation. This data could then be uploaded to
                a shared calendar. This solution eliminated simple human error
                when transferring lots of similar dates and skus repeatedly.

                <strong>Margin Calculator</strong>: Determining a final
                price/sqft for a product can be tricky, especially while
                negotiating with a customer. Vendor-specific surcharges,
                shipping, material type, and customer tier all need to be
                factored into the final markup. I created a simple calulator UI
                with AHK that makes it simple for salespeople to determine a
                fair, but profitable price quickly.

                <strong>Outlier Issue</strong>: The media the provided was
                hosted on Facebook and the client's profile was not relevent to
                his buisiness. I migrated them off Facebook and hosted them in
                an Amazon S3 bucket.
