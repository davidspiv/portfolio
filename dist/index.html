            <p>
              My coding journey began in 2020 when I creating an Autohotkey
              script to add control + a to Quickbooks Desktop. I soon began
              utilizing more of AHK and eventually JS in the Google Scripts
              environment. These early projects centered around my work as
              operations manager for a small business in the home improvment
              industry.

              <li>
                <strong>Sheets to Calendar</strong>: Navigating between the QB,
                Calendar, and Sheets user interfaces is slow and mistake-prone.
                I created an AHK script to pull CSV reports from QB for manual
                manipulation. This data could then be uploaded to a shared
                calendar. These set of tools eliminated simple human error when
                transferring lots of similar dates and numbers.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Margin Calendar</strong>: Determining a final price for
                a product is tricky, especially while in front of a customer.
                Vendor-specific surcharges, shipping, material type, and
                customer tier needs to be factored into the final markup. I
                created a simple calulator UI with AHK that makes it efficient
                for salespeople to arrive at the final price quickly.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              These tools and similar ones I created in this position allowed me
              to spend far less time communicating reliable data to accounting,
              the designer, and the customer. However, the Google Script
              ecosystem kept me largly unaware of the DOM or working with the
              app APIs under the hood.

                <strong>Outlier Issue</strong>: The media the provided was
                hosted on Facebook and the client's profile was not relevent to
                his buisiness. I migrated them off Facebook and hosted them in
                an Amazon S3 bucket.
