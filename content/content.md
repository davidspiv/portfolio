## Coding Journey

Born out of an unhealthy obsession to fixate on small problems, my coding journey started in early 2020. At the time, I worked in sales and operations for a small business in the home improvement industry. I became frustrated with the lack of a `ctrl + a` / "select all" shortcut in our POS system that was nearly ubiquitous in other software. Searching online, I was pleasantly surprised with the number of people who were bothered by relatively minor things like keyboard shortcuts, and how that community made the solution simple and accessible. This was in direct contrast to the watered-down support of professional software tools I was using on a daily basis. Empowered by my findings, I immediately began copy-pasting code from Stack Overflow and breaking things. Although ignorance proved no obstacle for me, I eventually employed successful solutions to a number of problems.

### Early Solutions

- Sheets to Calendar: Navigating / transferring data between QuickBooks desktop and the Google ecosystem via the UI is slow and mistake-prone. I created an AHK (AutoHotkey) script to pull CSV reports from QuickBooks to Sheets for manual manipulation. Purchase orders could then be added in groups or by line item to Google Calendar. This solution eliminated simple human error when manually transferring dates and SKUs repeatedly.

- Margin Calculator: Determining a final price/sqft for a product can be tricky, especially while negotiating with a customer. Vendor-specific surcharges, shipping, material type, and customer “tier” are essential to factor into the final price when selling in a competitive market. I created a calculator using AHK that allows the user to input the variables above and see a table of prices aligned with tiered margins. The program was designed to sit on top of any price books referenced in the browser, making it simple for salespeople to determine a fair, but profitable price quickly.
